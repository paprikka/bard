	<h1>Hi</h1>

	<p>
		Welcome to my (Medieval) Content Farm! Bard is a biased, hallucinated source of news curated by
		a team of our talented writers. Every day they scour the internet for the most interesting and
		relevant events of the realm. Meet the team <a href="/team">here</a>.

	<p>We are dedicated to providing you with the most accurate and up-to-date news possible.</p>

	<p>
		Is it real? Nothing is real! <a href="https://rafal.ck.page/products/tip">Money isn't real.</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Why?</h2>

	<p>
		We're worried that with the advent of LLMs we'll get flooded with plausible-sounding
		bot-generated content, tricking our bullshit filters and shifting our opinions to prefer Pepsi
		over Coke, political parasite #1 over political parasite #2.

	<p>I like turning problems into advantages.</p>

	<h3>Longer version</h3>
	<p>
		Large Language Models (LLMs) excell at creating plausible sounding bullshit. They are also very
		good at generating text that is similar to the training data. The might be able to generalise to
		other domains and create an illusion of realism, bypassing our bullshit filters, slowly shifting
		our opinions to prefer Pepsi over Coke.
		
		However, LLMs don't really understand what they
		say in the same way as humans do. They are not able to make sense of the world since their main
		job is to find a sequence of words following your prompt.
	</p>

	<p>
		All of that makes scaling up botnets and troll farms easier than ever before. And, the past 10
		years have shown us that shifting public opinions algorithmically via social media is not that
		hard.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is terrible for a variety of reasons. But one of the things I enjoy the most is flipping
		problems on their heads and turning them into solutions (or toys!).
	</p>
	<p>
		As I kid I was afraid of ghosts so I found a cheap camera and started photographing cemeteries.
		20 years later, I've seen 100+ locations, and now I see them as the most beautiful and alive
		places you can find. When I worked in ad-tech I managed to build a system turning our ad
		exchange into an adblocker where users could pay the publishers directly with money instead of
		frying their neurons. Uncle Murdock paid for that, which is probably the only thing from those
		times I'm proud of.
